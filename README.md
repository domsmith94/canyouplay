# canyouplay

<p> CanYouPlay is a lightweight sports team management application written in JavaScript. This was my final year project during my time studying Computer Science within ECS. </p>
<p> The application was designed to run on Heroku, but also works locally. Use npm install and then npm start to run locally</p>
